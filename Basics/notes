- you need to declare variables before you use them.
- always put ";" at the end of an expression.
- "std::" use because those name are found in standard-library namespace. We can use "using namespace std" after #include statement to avoid writting std::, but if we are using multiple namspaces then it
  is good to explicitly define namespace.
- There are only 4 fundamental type in c++: bool, char, int, and double
- if you want see the size of these types you can use the function "sizeof()"
